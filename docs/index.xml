      <description>Draft version (v0.1): this post is currently a public draft. Improvement suggestions are welcome and can be sent to contact (at) arduin.io.
Disclaimer: I am not an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and I wrote this post out of personal curiousity. Use my assement with care (and a pinch of salt).
Introduction Language models (LMs) are notoriosly difficult to evaluate. Modern LMs are used for a wide variety of complex downstream tasks, such as text translation or conversation.</description>

      <description>On this short page I describe some of the tweaks I used to set up this Hugo PaperMod site. This page also serves as a reminder to myself about what I did.
FAQ How can I easily change the size of images?
You need to allow unsafe rendering in the markdown renderer. As I am the only person adding and adapting content on this page this seemed to me to be a sensible thing to do.</description>

      <description>My current research focuses on how machine learning (ML) methods that generalise to solve problems at scale. In research settings, ML methods are often custom-tuned for particular problem instances without a clear path to scale. My work focuses on methods that generalise across problem instances and thus enable scale. In particular, I am currently looking at how meta reinforcement learning can help create adaptable building controllers that generalise across buildings to achieve new level of scale.</description>
