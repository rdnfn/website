      <description>In late 2022 and early 2023, we have seen major leaps in the field of AI with generative models like those underpinning the ChatGPT interface. Below are selected commentary pieces by AI researchers, leaders and commentators that make predictions about the future of AI following these leaps. I highly recommend looking at these links – they have been very influential on my own thinking and work.
